This project is now up-to-date with the latest changes (basically everything we've covered in class throughout October). This means AssetClass, AssetType and Asset, some tests, and nicely-layered UI are implemented. We have also implemented ConditionRating and Service Status and tied them back to Assets.

### Home assignments
- [x] implemented AC03 and AC04 user stories : ServiceStatus and ConditionRating
- [x] mostly implemented the AC05 user story and fixed the key generation problem
- [x] wrote up all the next issues (AC06 to AC14), some improvements are still pending


### Developer Manual

1. read the corresponding Asset Acquisition user story in the google drive folder, as well as analyse that story in the context of other user stories, planning ahead what functionality you might need
2. create an issue in which you describe the problem, the solution and the expected outcome, capturing all the requirements as stated in the user story
3. create a branch where you'll be working on your changes; the branch name has to correspond to the number of the issue you've created
4. implement the main functionality (moder and/or UI), as well as tests (**make sure they are green**)
5. commit the changes with a straightforward description, push the changes on the corresponding branch, and create a pull request in which reference the issue it resolves (# and number of the issue)
6. the PR will be merged after there's at least one approving review
