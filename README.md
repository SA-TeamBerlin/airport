This project is now up-to-date with the latest changes (basically everything we've covered in class throughout October). This means AssetClass, AssetType and Asset, some tests, and nicely-layered UI are implemented. We have also implemented ConditionRating and Service Status and tied them back to Assets.

### Home assignments
- [x] implemented user stories AC03-AC05 and AC08-AC09 (skipped through AC06-AC07 per instructions)
- [x] made some progress with implementing AC10-14


### Developer Manual

1. read the corresponding Asset Acquisition user story in the google drive folder, as well as analyse that story in the context of other user stories, planning ahead what functionality you might need
2. create an issue in which you describe the problem, the solution and the expected outcome, capturing all the requirements as stated in the user story
3. create a branch where you'll be working on your changes; the branch name has to correspond to the number of the issue you've created
4. implement the main functionality (moder and/or UI), as well as tests (**make sure they are green**)
5. commit the changes with a straightforward description, push the changes on the corresponding branch, and create a pull request in which reference the issue it resolves (# and number of the issue)
6. the PR will be merged after there's at least one approving review
